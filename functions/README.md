issues:
[] Remove default style on sidenav

[]Create Snackbar

[√] Register and Login get 304 code on submitHandler
Resolution:

[√] 'redux-form-material-ui' - When imported to register gives error that files relating to redux-form-material-ui can not be found in node_modules. We are using yarn for this project and the docs for this dependency only list npm commands. Do some packages only run on npm or yarn?
Resolution:
we don't need to use this after all.

[√]phone number seem to be messing with other inputs -https://codesandbox.io/s/0x7mqonlw0
Resolution:
missing props on value... I think.
